# BOUNCING-BALL
A game developed in python.

Bouncing Balls is an engaging and entertaining puzzle game that challenges players to match colored balls and prevent a wall of balls from advancing to the bottom of the screen. Sharpen your aiming skills and strategic thinking as you take control of a cannon, shooting orbs to clear the advancing wall and earn points.

## Game Objective

Your objective in Bouncing Balls is to remove the line of brightly colored balls that is slowly advancing towards the bottom of the screen. To achieve this, you must shoot balls at the wall, creating connections of three or more balls of the same color. When a match is made, the connected balls disappear, and any balls hanging beneath them also fall away.

## Gameplay Rules

1. **Aim and Shoot:** Use your cannon to aim and shoot balls at the advancing wall. Click or tap to release a ball from the cannon, and watch it bounce off the wall. Your goal is to strategically position the shot to create matches.

2. **Create Matches:** To remove balls from the wall, connect three or more balls of the same color with a well-placed shot. When a match is formed, the connected balls vanish from the wall.

3. **Chain Reactions:** Cleverly creating matches can trigger chain reactions, where falling balls from above create new matches automatically. Take advantage of these chain reactions to clear more balls with fewer shots.

4. **Bounce Shots:** Utilize the walls to your advantage by making shots that bounce off them. This technique can help you reach difficult-to-reach areas and set up satisfying combos.

5. **Advance Strategy:** As the wall advances, the challenge intensifies. Plan your shots carefully and think ahead to ensure you clear the balls before they reach the bottom line. The game gets progressively more challenging as you advance through levels.
